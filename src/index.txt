H2 About

INFO <strong>Adventures in JavaScript</strong> is a set of "branching path" books where, during the course of the adventure, the player (that's you) will learn how to create simple games using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

INFO Unlike most branching path adventure books, there are no wrong paths in these books that lead to your death. The choices merely determine the order in which you perform the various tasks necessary for the games. Two adventurers who choose different paths through one of these books will still end up in the same place at the end - they will both have created the same game.

INFO These books are intended to serve as a jumping off point so that students can continue to develop their programming skills by independently modifying and enhancing the sample games.

H2 How to play

INFO See the <a href="howtoplay.html">How to play</a> page.

H2 Current status

INFO For most of the books, the programming part of the game is complete, but the descriptive text and explanations are not. There are many placeholders where a section needs to be expanded with more information.

INFO However, all of the programming parts are in working order. The build process for this project walks through every possible pathway in the adventure and performs the code edits to ensure that everything works as intended. At the end of each stage, a check is made to verify that every pathway through that stage produces the exact same code.

H2 Development info

INFO For those who are curious, there are 2 development maps for book 1 (one for <a href="book01/docs/devmap-1-4.pdf">stages 1-4</a> and one for <a href="book01/docs/devmap-5.pdf">stage 5</a>) that show the overall structure of the game. These maps are not needed while playing.
