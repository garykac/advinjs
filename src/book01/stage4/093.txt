TITLE = Connecting the levels
ID = 093

B: To connect the levels, we need to modify the goal so that it indicates the next level to go to.

B: Since we don't have a "game over" level, we'll (temporarily) connect the last level back to the first.

U: doesn't that mean that the game will never yet.

B: Yes, but it's only temporary. We'll be adding a proper ending later.

BEGIN_CODE
-function create_goal(x, y) {
+function create_goal(x, y, next_level) {
.	var goal = {};
.	goal.x = x;
.	goal.y = y;
.	goal.width = 20;
.	goal.height = 20;
.	goal.origin_x = goal.width / 2;
.	goal.origin_y = goal.height;
+	goal.next_level = next_level;
.	return goal;
.}
END_CODE

B: and update all the calls:

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_level1() {
.	...
.	add_monsters(level, monster_data);
.
-	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
+	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360, 1);
.	...
.}
.
.function init_level2() {
.	...
.	add_default_platforms(level);
.
-	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
+	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360, 2);
.	...
.}
.
.function init_level3() {
.	...
.	add_default_platforms(level);
.
-	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
+	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360, 0);
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: level1 is at index #0 (_level[0]) and its goal points to level2 (@ index #1)


B: Add start_level:

BEGIN_CODE
.function create_goal(x, y, next_level) {
.	...
.}
.
+function start_level(level_id) {
+	_game.current_level = level_id;
+
+	var level = _levels[level_id];
+	_player.x = level.player_start_x;
+	_player.y = level.player_start_y;
+	_player.velocity_x = 0;
+	_player.velocity_y = 0;
+}
+
.// Erase the canvas and draw all the objects.
.function draw() {
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: When we start a level, we move the player to the appropriate starting location and remove any velocity they may have from the previous level.

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var goal = level.goal;
.	if (collide(goal, _player)) {
-		_game.game_over = true;
-		_game.game_win = true;
+		start_level(goal.next_level);
.	}
.}
END_CODE

U: Wait, now there's no way to win.

B: We should also call this after we finish initializing so that the game starts at the correct level.

BEGIN_CODE
.function handle_load(event) {
.	init();
+	start_level(0);
.	requestAnimationFrame(update_world);
.}
END_CODE

U: don't we already do this in init_game()


B: Now that we init the player at the start of each level, we no longer need to set x and y in init_player

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_player() {
+	// Player x,y are initialized by the level.
-	_player.x = 20;
+	_player.x = 0;
-	_player.y = 360;
+	_player.y = 0;
+
.	_player.width = 20;
.	_player.height = 20;
.	...
.}
END_CODE
