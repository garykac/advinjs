TITLE = Even more platforms
ID = 078

B: Try it out to see how it works.

B: When you land on the top it works well, but when you hit the bottom or sides, it acts a bit weird. You always jump to the top of the platform.

B: Indeed, all collisions with the platforms are currently assumed to be at the top.

B: To fix this, we need to do a better job with our collision detection. In addition to answering the question "did object A collide with object B", we also need to know if object B (the player) collided with the top, bottom, left or right of object A (the platform).

B: Not surprisingly, this is a bit more complicated than the simple collision detection we did earlier.

B: But before doing that add a few more platforms:

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	_game.platforms = [];
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40));
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(200, 290, 80, 20));
+	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(300, 240, 80, 20));
+	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(400, 170, 80, 20));
+	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(460, 110, 40, 20));
.	...
.}
END_CODE
