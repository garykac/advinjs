TITLE = Monster collisions
ID = 056

B: The monster is drawn, but you can just walk right through it. That's no fun.

B: We can update our collision to support monsters.


BEGIN_CODE
.function check_platform_collisions() {	
.	...
.}
.
+function check_monster_collisions() {
+	var monsters = _game.monsters;
+	for (var i = 0; i < monsters.length; i++) {
+		var m = monsters[i];
+		if (collide(m, _player)) {
+			_game.game_over = true;
+		}
+	}
+}
+
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: and update check_collisions():

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_collisions() {
.	check_platform_collisions();
+	check_monster_collisions();
.	check_goal_collisions();
.}
END_CODE

B: Now monsters are dangerous. If you collide with it the game will end. But you can easily jump over it at this time.


B: Adding a second monster is as easy as:

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	_game.monsters = [];
.	_game.monsters.push(create_monster(350, 360, 20, 20));
+	_game.monsters.push(create_monster(400, 360, 20, 20));
.	_game.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
.	...
.}
END_CODE
