B: Run. it should be the same.
B: Note that draw_ and check_collision only check the first (the 0th) element) of the array.

B: We can add another platform to the array, but it won't work until we iterate through all the elements of the array. WE do that with a for loop.

.function draw_platforms(ctx) {
+	var platforms = _game.platforms;

-		var platform = _game.platforms[0];

B: _game.platforms.length is the number of elements in the array.
B: Note that _game.platforms[0] is changed to _game.platforms[i].
