TITLE = Fixing the platforms
ID = 073

B: Now that we have the collision info, we can fix up the platforms.

B: To do that we need to change how we handle platform collisions

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_platform_collisions() {
.	var platforms = _game.platforms;
.	_player.platform = null;
.	for (var i = 0; i < platforms.length; i++) {
-		if (collide(platforms[i], _player)) {
-			_player.platform = platforms[i];
-			_player.y = platforms[i].y;
-			_player.velocity_y = 0;
+		var overlap = collide(platforms[i], _player);
+		if (overlap) {
+			// Adjust player location so it no longer overlaps with platform.
+			_player.x += overlap[0];
+			_player.y += overlap[1];
+
+			var dir = overlap[2];
+			if (dir == "left" || dir == "right") {
+				// Smack into left/right side of platform.
+				_player.velocity_x = 0;
+			} else if (dir == "top") {
+				// Land on top of platform.
+				_player.platform = platforms[i];
+				_player.velocity_y = 0;
+			} else {
+				// Bounce off bottom of platform.
+				_player.velocity_y *= -1;
+			}
.		}
.	}
.}
