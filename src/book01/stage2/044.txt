TITLE = Show game over
ID = 044

B: As I said earlier, all the code does so far is set a flag when it detects a collision. This makes it hard to verify that the code is actually working as intended.

B: We need to show something to the player when the game is over. We can do that in the =draw()= function.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Display a "game over" message.
.function draw() {
.	var canvas = document.getElementById("stage");
.	var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
.
.	erase(ctx);
.	draw_platforms(ctx);
.	draw_goal(ctx);
.	draw_player(ctx);
+
+	if (_game.game_over) {
+		// Dim out the stage by drawing a transparent black rectangle over it.
+		ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)";
+		ctx.fillRect(0, 0, _game.width, _game.height);
+
+		ctx.fillStyle = "black";
+		ctx.font = "48px Helvetica";
+		ctx.fillText("Game Over", 140, 150);
+	}
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: After making this change, when the player touches the goal, the screen will dim and a large "Game Over" message will be shown in the middle of the screen.
