B: And now if you run your code it will detect when the player touches the goal.

U: It's not working - I can walk over to the goal and the game doesn't end.

B: Actually, it is working. You just can't tell that it's working. When the player touches the goal, the boolean variable =game_over= is set to =true=. The problem is that we don't currently do anything special when the game is over.

U: We should fix that.

B: And that's just what we'll do next.
