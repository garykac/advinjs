U: Yay! We can jump.

U: well... sort of...

U: If I hold the jump button down, I can fly off the top of the screen.

B: Yes, apparently you can jump while you're in mid-air, which is not quite what we want. How do you think we should fix that?

U: You should only be allowed to jump if you're standing on a platform.

B: So we should add a variable to the player that keeps track of whether-or-not the player is currently on a platform.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Add a =platform= variable to the player.
.function init_player() {
.	...
.	_player.origin_x = _player.width / 2;
.	_player.origin_y = _player.height;
.
+	_player.platform = false;
+	
.	_player.velocity_x = 0;
.	_player.velocity_x_delta = 0.8;
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: And we need to check this variable whenever the player tries to jump.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Only allow jumps if the player is on a platform.
.function check_input() {
.	...
.	// Up arrow, 'w'  and spacebar to jump.
.	if (_game.keymap[38] || _game.keymap[87] || _game.keymap[32]) {
+		// Only allow jumps if the player is on a platform.
+		if (_player.platform) {
+			_player.platform = false;
>			_player.velocity_y = _player.velocity_y_jump;
+		}
.	}
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

U: It doesn't seem to work yet.

B: That's because we're not quite done. We now need to set the =platform= variable when the player is on a platform.
