TITLE = Collide with goal
ID = 041

B: We show the goal on the screen, but we want to detect when the player touches the goal and then end the game.

B: The first thing we need is a boolean variable that keeps track of whether or not the game is over. This should be initialized to =false=.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Add =game_over= variable.
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	// Game state.
+	_game.game_over = false;
.	_game.platform = create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40);
.	_game.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
.
.	// Global world parameters.
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Now that we have this variable, we can set it to =true= when the player touches (collides with) the goal that we just added.

B: We can add a =check_goal_collisions()= function to detect when the player collides with the goal object. If that happens, we set the =game_over= flag to =true=.

B: We're also temporarily adding a "dummy" version of the =collide()= function. This dummy version does nothing except return =false= (meaning no collision found). We'll be creating a proper version of =collide()= once we finish hooking up the goal collision code. We'll add a "NYI" comment to indicate that it's "Not Yet Implemented".

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Create the =check_goal_collisions()= function.
.function check_input() {
.	...
.}
.
+function check_goal_collisions() {
+	var goal = _game.goal;
+	if (collide(goal, _player)) {
+		_game.game_over = true;
+	}
+}
+
+// Return true if the 2 objects overlap.
+function collide(obj1, obj2) {
+	// NYI
+	return false;
+}
+
.// This is called ~60 times per second to update the world.
.function update_world() {
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Since we'll be doing a lot more collision detection, we might as well create a =check_collisions()= function that will check for all the collisions that we care about in the game.

B: Right now, we only have goal collisions, so we only need to call =check_goal_collisions()=. We'll be adding more to this function later.

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_input() {
.	...
.}
.
+function check_collisions() {
+	check_goal_collisions();
+}
+
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: And finally, we need to call our =check_collisions()= function. We need to do that in =update_world()= so that the game checks for collisions whenever anything moves on the screen.

BEGIN_CODE
.// This is called ~60 times per second to update the world.
.function update_world() {
.	update_player();
+	check_collisions();
.	draw();
.
.	requestAnimationFrame(update_world);
.}
END_CODE

B: The only thing missing is a proper =collide()= function. We'll add that now.
