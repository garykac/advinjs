TITLE = If goal

B: If you run the code now, the game will stop when you reach the third level. This is because we have code that assumes that each level has a 'goal' object. Since this is no longer the case, it will throw an exception (error) and stop when you get to a level without a goal (level 3 in our case).

B: We can fix this by making the code work by having the draw_goal() and check_goal_collisions() functions check to make sure it has a valid goal object before trying to draw it.


BEGIN_CODE
.function draw_goal(ctx) {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var goal = level.goal;
+	if (goal) {
>		var image = goal.img_closed;
>		if (level.player_has_key) {
>			image = goal.img_open;
>		}
>		set_transform(ctx, goal);
>		ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
>		reset_transform(ctx);
+	}
.}
END_CODE


BEGIN_CODE
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var goal = level.goal;
+	if (goal) {
>		if (collide(goal, _player) && level.player_has_key) {
>			start_level(goal.next_level);
>		}
+	}
.}
