ADMIN There are two ways to go through the next stage. The "easy" way forces you to do all the tasks in a particular set order, whereas the "challenge" path allows you to choose the order in which you add features to your fledgling game.

ADMIN Which path do you prefer?

ADMIN Note that they both end up with the same code in the end.

GOTO 200 IF take the straight and easy path

GOTO 101 IF take the challenging path
