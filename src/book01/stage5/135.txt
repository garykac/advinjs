B: Now that we have support for generic items, we have add different item types the behave differently.

B: The first item is a key that can be used to unlock the goal.

B: We have one key on each level that is used to unlock the goal. If the play does not have the key, they will not be able to enter the goal.

B: adds and only allow the goal to work if the player has the key for this level

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var goal = level.goal;
-	if (collide(goal, _player)) {
+	if (collide(goal, _player) && level.player_has_key) {
.		start_level(goal.next_level);
.	}
.}
END_CODE

B: with this change, the goal won't work until you get the key.

B: Unfortunately level 2 doesn't have a key, so you can't get to level 3 anymore.
