TITLE = Experimenting with width and height
ID = 007

B: Change the player's =width= and =height= and notice how it always rests properly on the platform. If we had just subtracted =20=, then changing the player's height would have resulted in the player overlapping the platform, or floating in the air above the platform.

U: OK. I'm slightly happier about the change now.

GOTO 008
