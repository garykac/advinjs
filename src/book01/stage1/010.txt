U: Alright, let's make the player move left and right.

B: Good. And how do you think you should go about doing that?

U: Umm.. by turning off the up and down keys?

B: Right. And do you know what code you need to remove to turn off those keys?

U: Well, the =check_input()= function handles the keyboard input. So I can just remove the parts that deal with the up arrow and down arrow.

B: Excellent, try that and verify that it works.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Delete the code that moves the player up and down.
.function check_input() {
.	...
.	// Right arrow or 'd' to move right.
.	if (_game.keymap[39] || _game.keymap[68]) {
.		_player.velocity_x = 1;
.	}
-	// Up arrow or 'w' to move up.
-	if (_game.keymap[38] || _game.keymap[87]) {
-		_player.velocity_y = -1;
-	}
-	// Down arrow or 's' to move up.
-	if (_game.keymap[40] || _game.keymap[83]) {
-		_player.velocity_y = 1;
-	}
.}
