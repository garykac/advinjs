U: I notice that the player can still go off the left/right side of the screen.

B: Hmm... you can put a temporary fix in =update_player()= to keep the player on the screen, but there's a proper fix that you'll be doing later.

U: What's the temporary fix?

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Add temporary fix to keep the player on the screen
.function update_player() {
.	...
.	// Move the player to the new location.
.	_player.x += _player.velocity_x;
.	_player.y += _player.velocity_y;
+
+	if (_player.x < 0) {
+		_player.x = 0;
+	} else if (_player.x > _game.width) {
+		_player.x = _game.width;
+	}
.}
END_CODE_OK

U: After doing that, I can't move the player completely offscreen, but I can still move it partway offscreen.

B: That's because we're constraining the origin of the player, and the player's origin is the center (horizontally). Don't worry about this for now, we'll be fixing this up properly later.
