TITLE = Player meets platform
ID = 005

U: OK, so let's move the player down onto the platform.

B: Do you have an idea on how to do that?

U: Well, I already set the =_player.x= and =_player.y= value to =0= in =init_player()=. I can just change those values can't I?

B: Correct. What should you change them to?

U: I can leave the =x= value as =0=, but I need to change the =y= value to the top of the platform, which is =360=, right?

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Move the player's starting y-position down to the platform.
.function init_player() {
.	_player.x = 0;
-	_player.y = 0;
+	_player.y = 360;
.	_player.width = 20;
.	_player.height = 20;
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Let's try that and see what happens.

U: Uh-oh, that doesn't sound promising.

U: Hey, the player is drawn under the platform. That's not right!
