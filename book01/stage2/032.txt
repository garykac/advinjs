TITLE = Check platform collisions
ID = 032

B: Whenever the player collides with a platform, we want to record that the player is on a platform.

B: We do this by initializing the =_player.platform= variable to =false= and then checking the platform to see if the player has collided with it. If the player has collided with the platform, then we set =_player.platform= to be =true=.

B: This works because gravity is constantly pulling the character down onto the platform. The only time the player will **not** be colliding with a platform is when the player is in the middle of a jump.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Record the platform if the player collides with it.
.function check_platform_collisions() {
+	_player.platform = false;
.	if (_player.y > _game.platform.y) {
+		_player.platform = true;
.		_player.y = _game.platform.y;
.		_player.velocity_y = 0;
.	}
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Make sure your player can jump around before continuing.
