TITLE = Use collide for jumps
ID = 046

B: But before we do that, now that we have this nifty =collide()= function, we can use it for our platform collisions as well.

B: Note that =collide()= needs each object to have an =origin_x= and =origin_y= set. Platforms don't have that, so we'll need to add them.

BEGIN_CODE
.function create_platform(x, y, width, height) {
.	var p = {};
.	p.x = x;
.	p.y = y;
.	p.width = width;
.	p.height = height;
+	p.origin_x = 0;
+	p.origin_y = 0;	
.	return p;
.}
END_CODE

B: And with that change, we can switch the platform collision detection over to using =collide()=.

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_platform_collisions() {
.	_player.platform = false;
-	if (_player.y > _game.platform.y) {
+	if (collide(_game.platform, _player)) {
.		_player.platform = true;
.		_player.y = _game.platform.y;
.		_player.velocity_y = 0;
.	}
.}
END_CODE

GOTO 044
