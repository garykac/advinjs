TITLE = Collide with platform
ID = 027

B: You already added a =collide()= function when you added the goal. You can re-use that function if you make one small change to how you've implemented platforms.

B: The =collide()= function expects each object being checked to have an =origin_x= and =origin_y=. You don't want to change the origin for the platforms, so these values can both be set to =0=.

BEGIN_CODE
.function create_platform(x, y, width, height) {
.	var p = {};
.	p.x = x;
.	p.y = y;
.	p.width = width;
.	p.height = height;
+	p.origin_x = 0;
+	p.origin_y = 0;	
.	return p;
.}
END_CODE

B: With that change in place, you can now add your platform collision checks.

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_collisions() {
+	check_platform_collisions();
.	check_goal_collisions();
.}
.
+function check_platform_collisions() {
+	if (collide(_game.platform, _player)) {
+		_player.y = _game.platform.y;
+		_player.velocity_y = 0;
+	}
+}
+
.function check_goal_collisions() {
.	...
.}
END_CODE
