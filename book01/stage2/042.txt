TITLE = Disable input
ID = 042

U: That's not a very satisfying ending. And the font is kinda ugly there.  

B: Yes, at this point the game is so simple that there is no sense of accomplishment when you finish the game, but we'll be adding more challenges to make it more interesting.

B: As for the font, we'll need to come back and fix that later.

B: But first notice that the player input still works after the game is supposed to be over. We should disable it when the game is over.

B: To do that, simply wrap the =check_input()= call with a =game_over= check. That way the game won't bother checking the player input once the game has ended.

B: When adding the =if= wrapper around =check_input()=, make sure the fix the indentation.
