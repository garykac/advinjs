TITLE = Keys for level 2 and 3
ID = 137


B: We can add a key to level 2

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_level2() {
.	...
.	add_default_platforms(level);
.
+	var item_data = [
+		[250, 360, 18, 20, "key", "key"],
+	];
+	add_items(level, item_data);
+
.	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360, 2);
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: Rather than add a key to level 3 (which would just allow us to loop back to level 1 in any case), we can add a new item that ends the game when you acquire it.


B: Copy the =gem.png= image into the =images/items= directory.

BEGIN_IMAGE_TABLE 1
TABLE_IMAGE images/items/gem.png 42x54 gem.png
END_IMAGE_TABLE

BEGIN_COPY_FILE
COPY_FILE images/items/gem.png
END_COPY_FILE


BEGIN_CODE
.function init_level3() {
.	...
.	add_default_platforms(level);
.
+	var item_data = [
+		[500, 360, 21, 27, "finish", "gem"],
+	];
+	add_items(level, item_data);
+
.	level.goal = create_goal(500, 360, 0);
.	
.	_levels.push(level);
.}
END_CODE


B: Note that you the goal doesn't indicate whether or not it is currently locked. We'll can fix that now.
