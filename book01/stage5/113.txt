TITLE = Unlocked goal image
ID = 113

B: Get open/close image

B: We need 2 images - one for the open gate and another for the closed gate.

BEGIN_IMAGE_TABLE 2
TABLE_IMAGE images/backgrounds/gate-closed.png 60x80 gate-closed.png
TABLE_IMAGE images/backgrounds/gate-open.png 60x80 gate-open.png
END_IMAGE_TABLE

BEGIN_COPY_FILE
COPY_FILE images/backgrounds/gate-closed.png
COPY_FILE images/backgrounds/gate-open.png
END_COPY_FILE

B: Since we'e changing the size of the goal, we need to update the width and height.

BEGIN_CODE
.function create_goal(x, y, next_level) {
.	var goal = {};
.	goal.x = x;
.	goal.y = y;
-	goal.width = 20;
+	goal.width = 30;
-	goal.height = 20;
+	goal.height = 40;
.	goal.origin_x = goal.width / 2;
.	goal.origin_y = goal.height;
.	goal.next_level = next_level;
+	goal.img_open = new Image();
+	goal.img_open.src = _game.imagedir_backgrounds + "gate-open.png";
+	goal.img_closed = new Image();
+	goal.img_closed.src = _game.imagedir_backgrounds + "gate-closed.png";
.	return goal;
.}
END_CODE

B: ???

BEGIN_CODE
.function draw_goal(ctx) {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var goal = level.goal;
-	ctx.fillStyle = "green";
-	ctx.fillRect(goal.x - goal.origin_x, goal.y - goal.origin_y,
-					goal.width, goal.height);
+	var image = goal.img_closed;
+	if (level.player_has_key) {
+		image = goal.img_open;
+	}
+	set_transform(ctx, goal);
+	ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
+	reset_transform(ctx);
.}
END_CODE

B: ???
