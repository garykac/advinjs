TITLE = Adding more platforms
ID = 070

B: Before we can add more platforms, we'll first need to fixup the =_player.platform= variable.

B: Once we start adding more platforms, storing a boolean (=true= or =false=) value in the =_player.platform= variable won't be good enough - we'll want to know **which** platform the player is standing on.

B: We can update =_player.platform= by initializing it to =null= (instead of =false=) and setting it to the platform (instead of =true=) when the player collides with a platform.

B: The =null= value simply means that there is no object stored in the variable - in our case, it means that there is no platform associated with the player.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Initializing the =platform= variable to =null=.
.function init_player() {
.	...
.	_player.origin_x = _player.width / 2;
.	_player.origin_y = _player.height;
.
-	_player.platform = false;
+	_player.platform = null;
.
.	_player.velocity_x = 0;
.	_player.velocity_x_delta = 0.8;
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Fortunately we can still use =_player.platform= in the =if= statement in =check_input()= because (in JavaScript) a =null= value will be interpreted as =false=. Any non-=null= value will be interpreted as =true=.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Updating =platform= to =null=.
.function check_input() {
.	...
.	// Up arrow, 'w'  and spacebar to jump.
.	if (_game.keymap[38] || _game.keymap[87] || _game.keymap[32]) {
.		// Only allow jumps if the player is on a platform.
.		if (_player.platform) {
-			_player.platform = false;
+			_player.platform = null;
.			_player.velocity_y = _player.velocity_y_jump;
.		}
.	}
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: The last place to fixup is the =check_platform_collisions()= function.

BEGIN_CODE
.function check_platform_collisions() {
-	_player.platform = false;
+	_player.platform = null;
.	if (collide(_game.platform, _player)) {
-		_player.platform = true;
+		_player.platform = _game.platform;
.		_player.y = _game.platform.y;
.		_player.velocity_y = 0;
.	}
.}
END_CODE

B: Now that the =_player.platform= variable has been updated, we can start adding more platforms.
