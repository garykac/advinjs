TITLE = Better side walls
ID = 074

B: Now that we have properly behaving platforms, we can add side walls on the left and right and remove our earlier code that constrained the player on the screen.


BEGIN_CODE
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	_game.platforms = [];
+	// The bottom brick platform along the bottom of the stage.
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40));
+	// The left offstage 'wall' to keep the player on the stage.
+	_game.platforms.push(
+		create_platform(-60, -_game.height, 60, 2 * _game.height));
+	// The right offstage 'wall' to keep the player on the stage.
+	_game.platforms.push(
+		create_platform(_game.width, -_game.height, 60, 2 * _game.height));
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(200, 290, 80, 20));
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(300, 240, 80, 20));
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(400, 170, 80, 20));
.	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(460, 110, 40, 20));
.	...
.}
END_CODE

B: Pay attention: Note that -_game.height looks a bit weird because of the negative sign next to the underscore in _game.

B: Now, we can remove:

BEGIN_CODE
.function update_player() {
.	...	
.	// Move the player to the new location.
.	_player.x += _player.velocity_x;
.	_player.y += _player.velocity_y;
-
-	if (_player.x < 0) {
-		_player.x = 0;
-	} else if (_player.x > _game.width) {
-		_player.x = _game.width;
-	}
.}
END_CODE


RUN_VERIFY

B: Note that the player now stays completely on the screen since it's colliding with a tall platform just offscreen.
