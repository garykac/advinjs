TITLE = Array of platforms
ID = 076

B: We do this by creating an array of platforms. Initially, the array will only have a single platform.

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	// Game state.
.	_game.game_over = false;
-	_game.platform = create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40);
+	_game.platforms = [];
+	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40));
.	_game.goal = create_goal(500, 360);
.	...
.}
END_CODE

GOTO 075
