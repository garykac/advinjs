TITLE = Array of platforms
ID = 077

B: Just like we did with the monsters, we need to add an array of platforms. Initially, the array will only have a single platform.

BEGIN_CODE
.function init_game() {
.	...
.	// Game state.
.	_game.game_over = false;
.	_game.game_win = false;
-	_game.platform = create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40);
+	_game.platforms = [];
+	_game.platforms.push(create_platform(0, 360, _game.width, 40));
.	_game.monsters = [];
.	...
.}
END_CODE

GOTO 075
