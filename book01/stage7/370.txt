TITLE = Adding pain
ID = 370

B: When the player touches the monster and loses health, it would be nice if the player sprite changed to indicate this..

U: I agree. It's always nice to show people in pain.

B: Err. Well, yes... I mean no. We're doing this simply to give the player a visual indication of when they're touching a monster.

U: Of course.

B: So let's add a new player image to show when the player is touching a monster.

BEGIN_IMAGE_TABLE 1
TABLE_IMAGE images/player/ooo.png 40x48 ooo.png
END_IMAGE_TABLE

BEGIN_COPY_FILE
COPY_FILE images/player/ooo.png
END_COPY_FILE

B: In the code, we need to create a new player sprite and also create a boolean variable to keep track of whether or not the player is currently touching the monster.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Add new sprite and =is_touching_monster= variable.
.function init_player() {
.	...
.	_player.platform = null;
.	_player.health_max = 50;
.	_player.health = _player.health_max;
+	_player.is_touching_monster = false;
.	_player.coins = 0;
.	_player.dir = 1;
.	...
.	_player.sprite = init_player_sprite("normal", 20, 24);
.	_player.sprite_sad = init_player_sprite("sad", 30, 17);
+	_player.sprite_ooo = init_player_sprite("ooo", 20, 24);
.	_player.sprite_happy = init_player_sprite("happy", 20, 24);
.	update_player_sprite();
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: And then we simply select this new sprite whenever the =is_touching_monster= variable is =true=.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Select the pain sprite when the player is touching a monster.
.function update_player_sprite() {
.	var sprite;
.	if (_player.health <= 0) {
.		sprite = _player.sprite_sad;
.	} else if (_game.game_win) {
.		sprite = _player.sprite_happy;
+	} else if (_player.is_touching_monster) {
+		sprite = _player.sprite_ooo;
.	} else {
.		sprite = _player.sprite;
.	}
.	...
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: And finally, we need to set =is_touching_monster= to =true= whenever the player is touching a monster. That is, whenever we detect a collision between the player and a monster.

BEGIN_CODE_INFO Update =is_touching_monster= based on monster collisions.
.function check_monster_collisions() {
.	var level = _levels[_game.current_level];
.	var monsters = level.monsters;
.	var damage = 0;
+	_player.is_touching_monster = false;
.	for (var i = 0; i < monsters.length; i++) {
.		var m = monsters[i];
.		if (collide(m, _player)) {
.			damage++;
+			_player.is_touching_monster = true;
.		}
.	}
.	if (damage != 0) {
.		adjust_health(-damage);
.	}
.}
END_CODE_OK

B: Run your code now and you should see the player sprite change to the new image whenever the player is touching a monster.
